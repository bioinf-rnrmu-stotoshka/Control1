The dataset contains information on the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in adults aged 18 years and older across various countries. 
The data was published in The Lancet medical journal in 2016 and is based on estimates from 
the Non-Communicable Disease Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC).

The dataset includes crude estimates of DM prevalence as a percentage of the adult population in each country, 
along with corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (UI). 
The estimates are based on data from population-based studies, national health surveys, and other sources, 
and were adjusted for differences in age and sex distribution.

The dataset covers 199 countries and territories, and the estimates are presented for both sexes combined as well 
as separately for males and females. The data was collected between 1980 and 2014, 
and the estimates are reported for different time periods within this range.
